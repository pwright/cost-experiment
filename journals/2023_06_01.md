- When a new connection is established from a client, the router looks at all the possible outgoing paths for that connection.
- These include locally connected destinations and inter-router paths to remote destinations.
- For each path, it considers the number of currently open connections.
- For the inter-router paths, it adds the cost.  It then chooses the path with the lowest number.
- The cost is a threshold for "spillover" to another location.
- Example:  Cost between A and B is set to 10.  There are two local destinations and at least one remote destination.
- If the number of connections from local clients is 20 or less (10 for each local service), the local services will be used for all of them.  Above 20, the remote destinations will start being used.
- Cost is additive (a threshold).
